# Apollo Router Core

The **Apollo Router Core** is a configurable, high-performance **graph router** written in Rust to run a [federated supergraph](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/) that uses [Apollo Federation 2](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/v2/federation-2/new-in-federation-2).

Apollo Router Core is free, source-available, well-tested, regularly benchmarked, includes most major features of Apollo Gateway and is able to serve production-scale workloads.

## GraphOS Router

In conjunction with the [Apollo GraphOS platform](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/platform), GraphOS Router is the enterprise-grade runtime plane and a client's entry point to your federated supergraph.
Configure it to secure your supergraph, monitor and optimize performance, extend functionality, and more.
